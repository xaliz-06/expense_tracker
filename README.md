# Expense Tracker

This is a React mini-project I've created with reference to Maximillian Schwartzmuller (Academind) React Course. This is a part of the course projects.

This is an Expense Tracker that let's the user to add expenses and their details like date, amount and title and also presents the expenses in a visually-appealling chart and let's the user to filter out the expenses year-wise.
